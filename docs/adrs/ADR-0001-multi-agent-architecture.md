# ADR-0001: Multi-Agent Architecture with MCP Tools

**Date:** 2024-01-15
**Status:** Accepted
**Deciders:** Engineering Team

## Context

We need an AI system that can handle complex real estate underwriting and strategy analysis tasks. The system must be extensible, maintainable, and capable of orchestrating multiple specialized tools.

## Decision

We will implement a multi-agent architecture where:

1. **Main Orchestrator** routes requests to specialized agents based on context and intent
2. **Specialized Agents** (Originations, Strategy, XYZ) handle domain-specific analysis
3. **MCP Tools** provide standardized interfaces for external services (RAG, Parser, FinDB, Web, Calc, Report)
4. **WebSocket streaming** enables real-time user interaction with tool tracing

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear separation of concerns between agents and tools
- Extensible architecture - easy to add new agents or tools
- Standardized MCP protocol ensures consistent tool integration
- Real-time streaming provides excellent user experience
- Tool tracing enables debugging and audit trails

**Negative:**
- Added complexity compared to monolithic approach
- Network overhead for tool communication
- Need to handle tool failures gracefully
- More components to monitor and maintain

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Monolithic LLM**: Single model handling all tasks - rejected due to lack of specialization
2. **Function Calling**: Direct function calls instead of MCP - rejected due to lack of standardization
3. **Microservices without MCP**: Custom protocols - rejected due to complexity of protocol design
